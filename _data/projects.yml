  title: Deep Digit Recognition
  description: This project deals with detecting digits from natural scene image using  neural networks
               It is implemented in keras framework with tensorflow backend and opencv.
               The detector network determines whether the region proposed by the MSER algorithm is a digit or not using CNN classifier.
               CLAHE technique is used before applying MSER on the dataset

  title: A Data mapping strategy for parallel data mining nodes in grid connected to a storage cloud
  description: An architecute to reduce the computation time to process data by distributing tasks to multiple systems. We also built a private storage cloud to store the data and the results from scratch to ensure high availability of the data.
