        Hi, my name is Manu and I am a results-driven software engineer with over 4 years of experience and a strong foundation in computer
science principles and research. Skilled in developing and implementing machine learning frameworks and
libraries, I have a proven track record of delivering successful projects for clients in the automobile and
banking industries. My passion lies in artificial intelligence and deep learning, where I continuously seek to
expand my knowledge and skills. I thrive in problem-solving and effectively collaborate with cross-functional
teams to drive project success. I love to play football, and chess and of course, eat some good food!
