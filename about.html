        Hi, my name is Manu and I'm a Machine Learning enthusiast. 
        I am currently pursuing MSc. Computer Science at TU Kaiserslautern, Germany.
        My first specialization is Intelligent Systems and my second specialization is Software Engineering.
        Also, I am currently working as a Scientific student assistant at Fraunhofer ITWM in the field of federated machine learning.
        I have previously worked at Societe Generale Global Solution Center, Bangalore, India as a DevOps Engineer for about 2.5 years and as a Full Stack Developer at Rantyasoft Pvt Ltd. for about 6 months.
        I am an enthusiastic technophile, programmer, and engineer.
        I have the ability to rapidly build a relationship and set up trust.
        I am a confident, determined, dedicated team player with fast learning and good communication skills.
        I love to play football, chess and of course eat some good food!
      </p>
